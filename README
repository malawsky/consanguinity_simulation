The following R code was used to produce simulated genotype data given a consanguinous scheme in Arciero et al, BioRxiv. 

#### how to run

The input is a ped and bim file in PLINK format and a list of IID names to include in the simulation. 
The output is a bed file in PLINK format with simulated genotypes.
The bim file should include the genetic distance in cM. Program should only be run on one chromosome at a time.

The following command is an example of how to run the simulation:

consang_cous("path_to_bim","path_to_ped",n,i,"output_prefix")

n is the number of simulated individual to generate (must be the appropriate multiple for a given function listed below).
i is the chromosome number

n should be a multiple of:
2 for siblings
5 for avuncular third generation
4 for avuncular second generation
3 for avuncular first generation
8 for first cousin first second generation
6 for first cousin first second generation
4 for first cousin first generation
5 for first cousin once removed
6 for second cousins
2 for unrelated
